WORK AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
======

* Feb 2022 - present: **Postdoctoral Research Scientist**
  * NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA 
  * Supervisor: Lee-Lueng Fu
  * I work within a specialized team focusing on Cal/Val activities for the SWOT mission. My contribution includes:
    - Analysis of output data (altimeters, moorings, glider) coming from a data assimilation (DA) system
    - Simulation of synthetics observations from the nature run (NR) using the same position as a multiplatform observation (altimeters, moorings, glider)
    - Analysis of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) output based on DA.

* Sep 2017 - Dec 2021: **Postdoctoral Research Scientist**
  * CNES & Mercator Ocean International, Toulouse, France 
  * Supervisors: Elisabeth Remi, Jean-Michle Lellouche & Pierre Yves Le Traon
  - Assessing the Impact of global altimetry data in Mercator Ocean forecasting systems through OSEs (Observing System Evaluations) experiments.
  - Ensuring choice of nadir altimeter (real data).
  - Assimilation of altimetry data.
  - Analysis of simulated global scale data.
  - Writing and presenting the scientific report and document highlighting the results.

* Nov 2017 - June 2021: **Doctoral Researcher**
  * CNES & Mercator Ocean International, Toulouse, France 
  * Supervisors: Pierre Yves Le Traon & Mounir Benkiran
  - Simulation of data from the future SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography) mission, Nadir altimeters and in-situ data.
  - Analysis of simulated global scale data in a complex ocean analysis and forecasting system.
  - Development of scientific algorithms.
  - Writing and presentation of scientific reports and documents.

* May 2017 - July 2017: **Post-Master Researcher Intern**
  * Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Bremerhaven, Germany 
  * Research topic: “Seasonal inflow of Warm Deep Water (WDW) in the Filchner Ronne ice shelf.”
  * Supervisors: Tore Hatterman & Svenja Ryan
  - Analysis and Validation of sea ice model outputs.

* May 2017 - July 2017: **Master Researcher intern**
  * ICPMA, Cotonou, Benin 
  * Research topic: “Exchange of passive tracers between the surface and subsurface of the Gulf of Mexico.”
  * Supervisor: Julien Jouanno
  - Analysis and Validation of sea ice model outputs.
