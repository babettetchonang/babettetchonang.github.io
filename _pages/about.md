Biography
---

I am a physical oceanographer in the [Ocean Circulation and Air-Sea Interaction group](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/division/earth-science/ocean-circulation-and-air-sea-interaction/) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), working with [Dr Lee-Lueng Fu](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Fu/) on NASA's upcoming [SWOT satellite mission](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/). My research focuses on mesoscale and submesoscale ocean variability. I moved to JPL in February 7, 2022 from [Mercator Ocean international (MOi)](https://www.mercator-ocean.eu/en/) at Toulouse France. I obtained my PhD from Université Toulouse 3, Paul Sabatier, France. During my PhD I worked with MOi’s data assimilation system to quantify the impact of Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite on ocean analysis and forcasting.
